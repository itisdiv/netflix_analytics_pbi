## Netflix Content Performance Dashboard – Case Study Summary

This Power BI project explored how ratings, votes, and genres vary across Netflix's global catalog, with a focus on extracting actionable content insights from raw datasets.

### Problem Context
As Netflix expands globally, understanding regional content performance and audience behavior is key to informed investment decisions. The challenge was to analyze large volumes of catalog data to surface trends across ratings, genre popularity, and country-specific preferences.

### Approach & Tools
Using Power BI, I cleaned and transformed Netflix's movie and TV listings to build an interactive dashboard. I analyzed content metadata (ratings, votes, genres, countries) to uncover user engagement trends and regional strengths. The dashboard enabled dynamic filtering by genre, country, and rating.

### Key Insights
- **Content Ratings & Votes**: Average rating hovered around 6.7. However, votes were heavily skewed, indicating that popularity and quality are often mismatched.
- **Genre Evaluation**: Comedy had the most titles but didn’t consistently attract high votes — highlighting the *Quality vs Popularity* paradox.
- **Regional Strengths**: The U.S. dominated content volume, but Japan and France stood out in niche genres, offering strategic regional storytelling strengths.
- **User-Led Exploration**: Users could quickly answer questions like *“What genres are trending in India?”* or *“Which titles have the highest ratings in New Zealand?”*

### Outcome
This project showcased how Power BI can transform static content data into a dynamic tool for business storytelling, trend discovery, and decision-making. The solution aligns with the real-world need for operational dashboards that drive strategic content and marketing efforts across diverse markets.
